Build 1098 - 28. 8. 2015
========================================================
FIX:
 * Fixed length and pause settings #74
 * GPS offset #41

ADDED:
 * Audio volume changed feedback #45
 * Acoustic feedback for buttons and page #14
 * Start-up / Exit sound
 * Manual takeoff/landing (via Long press in Flight time widget) 
 * 30s Timer in autostart detection to compensate drift
 * Weak lift alert #70
    - low frequency tone will be emitted when climb surpass weak lift value
      Example: Week lift settings is 3 (0.3m/s) and lift threshold is set 0.1m/s
               Buzzer will start low-frequency sound when climb will be grater
               then -0.2 m/s (0.1 - 0.3)
    * Added new menu entry Settings->Vario->Weak lift
        * Enabled - enable / disable weak lift alert
        * Sensitivity - this value (* 10cm/s) will be subtracted from lift threshold
                      and used as weak lift value
        * Buzzer frequency - start frequency of weak lift alert (end frequency is first beep)
 * Flight time will not be changed during gps sync and manual time settings #55
 * Ability to change page number (1-5) #43
    * Added new menu
        Layouts -> Page Count
 * Widget glide ratio #59
    so far drop can't detect circling so do not expect the value will be invalid during 
    thermals

CHANGED:
 * Internal organisation of configuration structures fc & config (memory optimisation)
 * Audio vario generation
 * General Volume -> Vario volume
                  -> Alert volume
                  -> Menu volume
 * 5 Step volume settings 0% / 25% / 50% / 75% / 100% #50


Build 0910 - 28. 8. 2015
========================================================
FIX:

 * Device generate configuration file CFG.EE before power down. (for configurator)
 * Audio vario test Settings->Audio->Vario demo
 * Online configurator on http://vps.skybean.eu:8080/configurator #33

CHANGED:
 * Sub menu on main screen now wait 3 seconds instead of 1. #55
 * Buzzer duty cycle is reduced to 20% due to power consumption optimisation
 * Audio subsystem reworked
 * EEPROM configuration separated from calibration data
 

Build 0789 - 8. 7. 2015
========================================================

CHANGED:
 * support for Atmel Studio renamed files from .cc to .cpp 


Build 0551 - 30. 6. 2015
========================================================
ADDED:
 * 2 ways to reset factory test
    * place any file called RST_FT 
        - when you can't use LCD due wrong contrast settings
        - in next power on it will trigger Factory test reset
    * via menu
        * Settings -> Debug -> Reset Factory test


Build 0530 - 29. 6. 2015
